# Soundboard

A silly toy webpage where you can click/tap to play sound effects and troll your friends/coworkers. This
can be saved to your iPhone home screen and function like an application.

A lot of the JavaScript is originally from
[Getting Started with Web Audio API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/) by Boris Smus.

### Setup

This is a static webpage so if you want to host your own Soundboard, all you have to do to get started is upload
this project's files to a directory on your web server.

This project doesn't include any audio files by default, so it won't work until you add your own. To do so:

1. Put your audio files (mp3/m4a/wav) in the `audio` directory.
2. Edit the `sounds.js` file to reflect your file paths and the labels you want to use for each button.
